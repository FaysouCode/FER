# Fayçal's Engine for RayCasting (FER)

## Overview
FER (Fayçal's Engine for RayCasting) is a simple raycast engine developed as part of my journey in learning C++. The project aims to recreate the iconic Wolfenstein 3D experience, which captivated audiences with its impressive pseudo-3D rendering technique. FER serves as a stepping stone towards my ultimate goal of creating a Doom-like engine.

## Motivation
The fascination with Wolfenstein 3D's unique approach to simulating a three-dimensional world has inspired me to embark on this project. By delving into the intricacies of raycasting, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the techniques employed in creating immersive game environments. FER represents the first significant milestone in my pursuit of this knowledge.

## Evaluation
Determining the quality of FER is subjective, and I welcome your feedback. As an ongoing learner, I strive to improve and refine the engine based on user experiences and suggestions. Therefore, I invite you to try out FER and provide your valuable insights. Your feedback will contribute to the further development and enhancement of the engine.

Thank you for your interest in Fayçal's Engine for RayCasting (FER). I look forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences with the project.
